#  Readability-Navigator  
### Adaptive Text Recommender System for Students with Learning Disabilities

---

## Overview

**Readability-Navigator** is an academic project developed at the **University of Turin** for the courses *“Personalized and secure Web || Artificial Intelligence”*.  
The goal is to support students with **dyslexia or reading difficulties (DSA)** through a **personalized recommender system** that suggests texts matching both their **interests** and **reading ability**.

Instead of simplifying text, the system **selects the next best document** whose topic and difficulty are optimal for the user's cognitive level.  
It monitors progress, avoids overload, and adapts automatically to help users improve reading comprehension step by step.

## Objectives

- Estimate **text readability** using linguistic metrics (e.g., Flesch, Gulpease).  
- Build a **user profile** that includes reading level and interests.  
- Recommend the “right text” balancing:
  - **Semantic similarity** between text and interests  
  - **Readability distance** from the user’s current level  
- Collect **feedback** (time, completion, difficulty) to adjust the next recommendation.  
- Provide an **accessible interface** (font for dyslexia, high contrast, TTS option).

##  System Architecture

User → Profile (topic_vector, readability_target)
→ Retrieve texts by topic similarity
→ Filter by readability tolerance
→ Score = η·semantic_similarity − ζ·|readability − target|
→ Rank and recommend Top-K
→ Collect feedback (time, completion)
→ Update user profile (new target + updated interests)

##  How It Works

1. **Data preprocessing**  
   Clean and tokenize texts, remove markup, and calculate readability scores.

2. **Feature extraction**  
   Compute text readability (e.g., Flesch) and semantic embeddings (SBERT).

3. **User modeling**  
   - Collect user interests and reading test.  
   - Estimate initial readability target.  
   - Store as `user_profile.json` with embedding and target.

4. **Recommendation**  
   Retrieve top-N texts by semantic similarity,  
   filter those near the target difficulty,  
   and compute:
   \[
   score(u,d) = η·sim_{topic}(u,d) − ζ·|readability(d) − target_u|
   \]
   Then recommend the Top-K.

5. **Feedback loop**  
   Measure reading time, completion, or skips.  
   Adjust target difficulty:
   - +Δ if easy  
   - −Δ if difficult or abandoned.  
   Update interests over time.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Assess with metrics: NDCG@k, Target-Deviation@k, and Completion Rate.
